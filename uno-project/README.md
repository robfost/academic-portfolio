# UNO Project (C++)

This was a final academic project designed to simulate gameplay mechanics similar to the card game UNO. The application allows users to enter player names and conduct multiple rounds of play, with operator overloading used to present card and player status cleanly in output.

## Project Overview

- The program initializes player data and executes the game loop through the `Game` class.
- Operator overloads allow `Card` and `Player` objects to be displayed in a readable format.
- Includes basic interaction prompts and replay capability.
- Game logic is distributed across external header files (`main.h`, `game.h`), which structured the core functionality.

## Technologies Used

- C++  
- Standard Template Library (STL): `vector`, `string`, `ostream`  
- Object-Oriented Design and Encapsulation  
- Operator Overloading  
- Header File Modularization

## Status

This project remains incomplete and was submitted as part of final coursework. Source files are preserved for archival and learning purposes. Future updates may include a complete rule set, full card deck logic, and win/loss conditions.
