# UNO Project

This project was developed as part of academic coursework in C++. It simulates core elements of the card game UNO, including player setup, card representation, and basic game flow. The program utilizes object-oriented design principles and operator overloading to manage gameplay and display output.

## Overview

- Initializes multiple players and prompts for user input
- Implements a game loop through the `Game` class
- Uses overloaded `<<` operators to display `Card` and `Player` objects
- Modular structure with supporting header files (`main.h`, `game.h`, `card.h`, `deck.h`, etc.)

## Technologies Used

- C++  
- Standard Template Library (`vector`, `string`, `iostream`)  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Operator Overloading  
- Header File Organization

## Structure and Design

The project is organized into modular components (`Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, `Game`) with encapsulated logic and operator overloading for clean output. Header files define the structure and relationships between game entities, supporting future expansion and rule implementation.

## Status

This project remains incomplete and is preserved as a learning artifact and example of early design work. Future revisions may include expanded rule logic, card deck management, and win/loss conditions.
