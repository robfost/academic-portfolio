# C++ Projects

This collection contains C++ programming exercises and coursework developed during my academic studies. Each project reflects specific learning objectives, including object-oriented design, input/output control, custom class structures, and foundational game mechanics. These entries are preserved as part of my broader portfolio to illustrate early programming experience and conceptual development.

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains source code and documentation for a single project:

- `soldiers-game/` — Command-line simulation featuring a small squad of soldiers with static data tracking and user interaction
- `uno-project/` — A partial implementation of a card game based on UNO, using operator overloading and modular gameplay architecture
- *(Additional projects will be added as they are reconstructed)*

## Notes

These projects vary in completeness and complexity. While some were finalized and submitted for academic credit, others remain partial or experimental. They are presented here in original or recovered form and reflect both technical exploration and design growth.

Additional documentation will be added as more projects are reviewed and restructured.
