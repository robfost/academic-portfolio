# Academic Portfolio

This repository serves as a curated archive of my academic programming projects and coursework from Southwestern College, Butler Community College, and Wichita State University. The materials contained here reflect early stages of my development as a programmer and demonstrate the breadth of concepts covered throughout my studies.

## Contents

Each subdirectory includes source code, project notes, and brief documentation outlining the purpose and learning objectives of the respective assignment.

- `soldiers-game-2008/` â€” C++ console application simulating basic soldier actions through class-based logic
- *(Additional folders will be listed here as more projects are added)*

## Purpose

This portfolio was created to provide insight into my foundational programming experience and to serve as a record of my progression through various languages, technologies, and design principles. These academic and exploratory projects illustrate key problem-solving strategies, design thinking, and the application of coursework in practical form.

## Notes

Many of these projects were produced in instructional environments and are presented in their original form or reconstructed from preserved source files. Their inclusion reflects not only the technical material covered but the educational context in which I engaged with programming as a discipline.

Additional entries will be added over time as I continue to recover and document coursework from prior academic terms.
